            <p>The Choose of software is a big part in being a designer, but I would say it doesn't really matter that much, It all comes to what you prefer, workflow wise and 
                how the software feels and look like. so it can be anything that you prefer. Mostly people go for the adobe pack since that is a industry standard and is very well known.
                now more recently alot of diffrent software has come up to people radar but most people stick to the adobe pack.

        <p> Design is an art form, a method of human expression that follows a system of highly developed procedures in order to imbue objects, 
            performances, and experiences with significance. Like all art forms, design has the potential to solve problems, 
            but there is no guarantee that it will. to get in to design you need the understanding of;

        <h2>What is the diffrence between design and art</h2> 
        <p> Design plays a part in almost every element of our daily lives. Design is observed in fashion, interiors, products, video games, software interfaces, branding, animation, publishing, advertising, and many more industries. 

        </p>
        <p> Design is practical and doesn’t focus purely on aesthetics. Design is not about adding ornaments to an item. Even with striking fashion or interior design, a product must first and foremost be practical and functional. Unlike art, designers must put the end user’s needs before their desires.

            Designers can – and do – express feelings and ideas through their designs, but self-expression is not the prime objective of a good design. A designer’s artistic skills and creativity are still essential, but creating a practical item, tool or experience is the top priority.  
        </p>
        <p> There are many commonalities between art and design, but there are also many differences. Overall, one of the main differences between these two disciplines is that design is more creatively restrained. 

            Artists can usually look at their artwork and see it as a form of self-expression or even as an extension of themselves. Designers don’t have the same liberty for self-expression and are far more confined to meeting the end-user requirements. 
            Differences Between Art and Design
            
                Designers always work from a brief with specific requirements. Artists can work on commissions, but they usually have more creative freedom of expression.
                Design always needs functionality, while art only has to exist.
                Designs have to solve problems, while art should provoke thought and emotions.
                Designers work methodically with a data-driven or mathematical process, while artists work intuitively using their instinct.
                Art is perceptual, while a design is rational.
                Designs are created for others; art is for oneself.
                Artistic ability is perceived to be foremost a natural gift, while design skills can be taught and honed.
                Designers must compromise their vision if it conflicts with commercial aims and goals, while artists do not have to make such concessions.
                Design always has a purpose, while art can serve any purpose the artist chooses, no purpose at all, or a vague or interpretative purpose.
                Art is unconstrained, but a design has many constraints, such as clients, business goals, and user needs.
            

        </p>
        <p> The relationship between art and design is close, with boundaries that are ever-changing and often blurred. Throughout history, art has influenced design, and sometimes design has influenced art. Modern and contemporary art, in particular, can be closely linked to design trends. 

            Modern art movements like Pop Art were heavily influenced by design disciplines such as advertising, publishing, and product design. Some fine artists like Andy Warhol took the product designs of everyday items like Campbell’s Soup and printed them on canvas to create artworks. Roy Lichtenstein took inspiration from comic book designers and used their techniques to create fine art paintings. 
            
            Several Pop Art artists started their careers in commercial design. As they moved into fine art they took publishing and commercial printing techniques and used the same techniques to create paintings. Other Pop Art artists took actual cuttings from magazine and newspaper graphic designs and turned them into mixed media collages.

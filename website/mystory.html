           <p>I Started out around the age of 6/7 and I was in love with making my own stuff and art, so I was really driven to make people recongize that it was my own art, 
               in order for me to get better I worked for almost everyday until I imrpoved my own sort of style to the point that I could make this my own form of income.</p>

               <dd>I did start of in kunskapsskolan which was more of you study on your own this made me learn about deadlines more,
                   it made me work more effective and also helped me with clients since I learned and created work ethics to make it easier for me. 
                   After that I start in International it college of sweden to find myself with people that could help me improve, 
                   since I got to work with some amazing people, I also got in contact with people that could help me with my busniness 
                   and evolve in how to sell myself out more to the indrusty. </dd>
